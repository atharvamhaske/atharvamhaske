- [**chash**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/chash) — Bare-bones implementation of consistent hashing in Go to understand distributed systems, node membership, and minimal key redistribution.

- [**gossippg**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/gossippg) — Lightweight PostgreSQL `LISTEN / NOTIFY` listener in Go for handling JSON payloads and event-driven workflows.

- [**gracely**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/gracely) — Graceful shutdown patterns for concurrent Go services using contexts, channels, and signal handling.

- [**tcpie**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/tcpie) — High-performance TCP server in Go built from scratch using goroutines, worker pools, and concurrency limits.

- [**chillMarGo**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/chillMarGo) — Token Bucket based rate limiter in Go for traffic control and backend protection.

- [**go-tly (WIP)**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/go-tly) — Over-engineered URL shortener to explore system design, performance tuning, and distributed backend concepts.

- [**go-ecom**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/go-ecom) — RESTful e-commerce backend API in Go with PostgreSQL, order workflows, and clean architecture patterns.

- [**autostack**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/autostack) — Code generation tool that produces TanStack (React Query) hooks directly from Express backend APIs.

- [**erdgen-app**](https://github.com/atharvamhaske/erdgen-app) — Developer tool to visualize Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) from Prisma schemas.


### challenges i tried:
