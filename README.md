## Projects:

### concurrency-bugs  
All my learning from reading the famous Go research paper **“Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go”**.  
This repository contains hands-on notes and runnable examples while studying real production concurrency bugs, why they happen, and how to reason about them correctly in Go.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/concurrency-bugs

---

### chash  
A bare-bones implementation of **consistent hashing in Go** to deeply understand how distributed systems work.  
Supports efficient key-to-node mapping with minimal redistribution during node addition or removal.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/chash

---

### gossippg  
A tiny **PostgreSQL LISTEN / NOTIFY** listener written in Go.  
It listens for DB notifications, decodes JSON payloads, and dispatches them to handlers — useful for CDC-like workflows.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/gossippg

---

### gracely  
Implementation of **graceful shutdown patterns** for concurrent systems in Go.  
Demonstrates clean shutdown of servers with job queues using contexts, channels, and signal handling.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/gracely

---

### tcpie  
A **high-performance TCP server** built from scratch in Go.  
Handles multiple concurrent connections using goroutines, worker pools, and configurable concurrency limits.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/tcpie

---

### chillMarGo  
A **rate limiter** implemented in Go using the **Token Bucket algorithm**.  
Built to understand traffic control, throttling, and backend protection patterns.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/chillMarGo

---

### gsync-awaity  
A tiny experimental implementation of **async / await behavior in Go**.  
Built using goroutines and channels to explore async abstractions and concurrency patterns.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/gsync-awaity

---

### go-tly (WIP)  
An **over-engineered URL shortener** built for learning system design.  
Explores performance, gRPC, backend architecture, and scalability patterns in Go.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/go-tly

---

### go-ecom  
A **RESTful e-commerce backend API** built in Go.  
Includes product management, order workflows, PostgreSQL persistence, and clean backend architecture.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/go-ecom

---

### autostack  
A code-generation tool that **automatically generates TanStack (React Query) hooks** from Express backend APIs.  
Built to improve frontend-backend integration speed and reduce boilerplate.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/autostack

---

### erdgen-app  
A developer tool to **visualize ER diagrams from Prisma schemas**.  
Helps understand database structure visually during development.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/erdgen-app

---

## Challenges i tried:

### challenge-go  
My Go implementation of the **one-to-n student grading challenge**.  
Focused on clean logic, modular structure, and idiomatic Go code.

Repo: https://github.com/atharvamhaske/challenge-go
